/**
 *  A test case to ensure that Groovy can compile class names and variable names with non-ASCII
 *  characters and that non-ASCII characters in Strings do the right thing.
 *
 *  <p>Unfortunately, we cannot actually have this test in the Subversion store since it
 *  requires having an encoding.  Java internally uses UTF-16.  Most Linux/UNIX/Mac OS X users
 *  use UTF-8 (or if they haven't caught up yet ISO-8859-{1..15], in Europe anyway).  Windows
 *  internally is UTF-16 LE but it appears that the Europe region defaults to ISO-8859-1 which
 *  is very silly.  All in all we cannot gurantee an ecoding so we cannot have the tests.</p>
 *
 *  <p>If anyone spots any errors in the rationale or finds a way to fix things please update at
 *  will.</p>
