/**
 * This is an annotaton on a class, currently just {@link ASTTransformation}.
 * This provides information about how and when to apply the transformation,
 * such as what phase it should be applied in.
 *
 * The allowed phase is a function of how the transformation is introduced
 * into the compile process.  If the transform is automatically added via a
 * marker annotation only the SEMANTIC_ANALYSIS and latter phases are legal
 * for the phase().  This is because the annotations are not inspected until
 * after the classes are all resolved.
 *
 * Also, only annotation types present during the SEMANTIC_ANALYSIS phase
 * will be handled.  Transformations adding other annotations that are
 * transformable will have those new annotations only considered in
 * latter phases, and only if the type was present in the source unit
 * during SEMANTIC_ANALYSIS.
