/**
 * Class annotation used for making a class immutable.
 * </p>
 * It allows you to write code snippets like this:
 * <pre>
 * {@code @Immutable} final class Customer {
 *     String first, last
 *     int age
 *     Date since
 *     Collection favItems
 * }
 * def d = new Date()
 * def c1 = new Customer(first:'Tom', last:'Jones', age:21, since:d, favItems:['Books', 'Games'])
 * def c2 = new Customer('Tom', 'Jones', 21, d, ['Books', 'Games'])
 * assert c1 == c2
 * </pre>
 * A class created in this way has the following characteristics:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Properties automatically have private, final backing fields with getters.
 * Attempts to update the property will result in a {@code ReadOnlyPropertyException}.
 * <li>A map-based constructor is provided which allows you to set properties by name.
 * <li>A tuple-style constructor is provided which allows you to set properties in the same order as they are defined.
 * <li>Default {@code equals}, {@code hashCode} and {@code toString} methods are provided based on the property values.
 * <li>{@code Date}s, {@code Cloneable}s and arrays are defensively copied on the way in (constructor) and out (getters).
 * Arrays and cloneable objects use the {@code clone} method. For your own classes,
 * it is up to you to define this method and use deep cloning if appropriate.
 * <li>{@code Collection}s and {@code Map}s are wrapped by immutable wrapper classes (but not deeply cloned!).
 * Attempts to update them will result in an {@code UnsupportedOperationException}.
 * <li>Fields that are enums or other {@code @Immutable} classes are allowed but for an
 * otherwise possible mutable property type, an error is thrown.
 * <li>You don't have to follow Groovy's normal property conventions, e.g. you can create an explicit private field and
 * then you can write explicit get and set methods. Such an approach, isn't currently prohibited (to give you some
 * wiggle room to get around these conventions) but any fields created in this way are deemed not to be part of the
 * significant state of the object and aren't factored into the {@code equals} or {@code hashCode} methods.
 * Use at your own risk!
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * Such classes are particularly useful for functional and concurrent styles of programming
 * and for use as key values within maps.
